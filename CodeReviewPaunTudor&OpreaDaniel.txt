I can appreciate the effort to make this assignment in c++.  I find it rather challenging operating in this language.


void concat (string a, string b) 

- this is the concatenation function for first and follow. It is pretty complicated, I would recommend instead of using the global variable result to use a local one and returning. And also, u verify for each component in a every component in b. U could have used a SET and add all elements from A, and if a contains epsilon (space in ur case) add all from b. This would have been more efficient.

void FIRST()

fi and fz kinda hard to understand their meaning without suggestive names... Otherwise the algorithm seems clear, but some commentaries would have been better. 

void Follow()

- this has very nice names, very explicit. 
For productions like S->BA where u put in Follow of A follow of S, I would say you could rewrite it easier by making sets and adding them in 2 for's, without having to check them.
- the function looks pretty big, but it is explicit and yet again a set would have helped it look a little better.

void createParseTable()

-crystal clear, suggestive names, nice.

bool checkSequence(string s)

- if(true) ? - why ?
- very nice function otherwise... Playing with & operand and recursive function, made this function pretty easy to write, easier than ours. (congrats)


void printTree()

-nothing to say, just your way of printing. 

void printParseTable()

-yet again just printing. Using java would have been easier for you I guess :D


int main()

-maybe the clearest function :)), easy to understand, but I would recommend in future to divide the output and input in another function, and so on, anyways great job.
